# Motion-In-Motion episode syncer

Simple script to download motion-in-motion episodes for offline viewing. You must have a paid subscription to use this script.

## Inspiration
I really like to watch episodes in transit/on-the-run - this script made it easy for me to download the episodes and have them available.

## Usage
Install the gems

```
bundle install
```

Create a .env file with your credentials as seen in the sample file

Run the Script
```
ruby sync_episodes.rb
```
